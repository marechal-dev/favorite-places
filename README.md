# Favorite Places App

This is a nice app for taking note of your favorite places!

I made this one for practing the use of Native features from devices, like the Camera,
Location and the device embedded SQLite.

I used the Free Tier of Google Cloud Platform Static Maps and Reverse Geocoding
APIs in order to create the functionalities.

## ðŸš€ How to get up and running

1. Create a free-tier account on Google Cloud Platform
2. `git clone` this repository
3. Create a `.env` file on the project root following the `.env.example` file
4. Run `npm install` on the project root
5. Run `npm run start:YOUR_OS`, changing `YOUR_OS` either to `android` or `ios`
